# Student Dropout Prediction Model

This project predicts whether a student is likely to drop out based on academic and personal factors.  
I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and relationships in the data, followed by feature engineering to improve model performance.  

Multiple machine learning models were used â€” Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost.
A simple Gradio interface was also built so users can enter student details and get real-time dropout predictions.  

The project is built using Python, Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost and Jupyter Notebook.
